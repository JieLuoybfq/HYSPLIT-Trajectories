# Visualizing Hysplit Trajectories
The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model also known as HYSPLIT is a complete system for computing simple air parcel trajectories, as well as complex transport, dispersion, chemical transformation, and deposition simulations.The GUI of this NOAA model is tcl based with limited options and it often is rigid.To remove this limitation python can be employed to create beautiful Visualizations.This Project Aims to introduce the vizualization of Backtrajectories by using python.
